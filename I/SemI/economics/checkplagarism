Israel remains one of the most stable countries in the Middle East, despite an extremely diverse society marked with cultural and political differences between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews, Jews of Middle Eastern and European descent, and the split between the Jewish majority and the Arab Palestinian minority. Israel’s fragmented political scene invariably produces year on year, large coalition governments but there is a strong commitment to the rules of the parliamentary democracy.

Politics in Israel is never dull and important shifts in the coountry's direction over the past two decades have had considerable effects on the Socio-Political situation. Israel has moved away from the economic model built by the early founders of the state, toward more liberal policies with a greater emphasis for the private sector. The economy prospered as a result, but the economic gap between highest and lowest strata widened resulting in harsh living conditions for the poorer section of the society.

The to be generation of Israelis find it increasingly difficult to secure stable employment and affordable housing among other issues such as the prices of basic goods rising. A wave of mass protest erupted in 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Israelis of different backgrounds demanded more social justice and jobs. There is a strong sense of uncertainty in the hearts of the younger population over the future and a lot of resentment against the political class as a whole.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came on top of the parliamentary elections held on January 22. Netanyahu faces tough times in backing controversial budget cuts that were extremely unpopular with Israelis who were still struggling to keep up with rising prices.

The “Arab Spring” in early 2011, a series of anti-government groups in Arab countries threatened  to disrupt the relatively favorable geopolitical balance Israel had enjoyed in recent years. Interestingly, Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that recognize the State of Israel, and Israel’s long-time ally in Egypt, former president Hosni Mubarak, had already been swept away and replaced with an Islamist government. 
\\
\\
The relations with the rest of the Arab world are unstable to say the least and even hostile. Israel has few ally countries in the region. However, the once close strategic relationship with Turkey has disintegrated, Israeli policy makers fret over Iran’s nuclear program and its links to Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza, presence of Al Qaeda-linked groups among the rebels fighting the government troops in Syria is the latest item on the security agenda. The future of the peace process exhibits no potential.

\subsection{Contemporary Political and Economic Issues}
In November 2015, the EU decided to impose a label on goods originating from the so-called ‘Israeli-occupied territories’. Israel’s Economy Ministry estimates the impact will be about \$50 million a year (but still only a small sum compared to the \$30 billion of goods and services Israel exports to the EU each year). The EU also requires any private Israeli entity that wants to receive funding from the EU to demonstrate that it has no links to the West Bank, East Jerusalem, or the Golan Heights. Any new agreements between Israel and the EU should include a provision stating that Jewish communities in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are not part of Israel (since the EU deems these areas as “occupied territories”). The effect is to limit finance for new Israeli settlements in these areas.
\\
\\
One strong gauge of Europe’s negative political attitude towards Israel is its voting record in the United Nations (UN). Europe’s voting at the UN is influenced by the EU and shows a longstanding anti-Israeli bias. Every year the UN General Assembly passes between 18 and 22 anti-Israeli resolutions, and generally speaking the Europeans support these resolutions. Another example of EU political bias is seen in the frequent condemnations of Israel from Brussels.
\\
\\
In recent years Israel’s relationship with her strongest ally, the US, has sunk to an all-time low. This is attributed in part to Israel’s pursuit of her settlement policies on the West Bank and her building policies in Jerusalem. As a result, the US could even withdraw her diplomatic cover or shield for Israel at the United Nations. At present this cover protects Israel’s desire to maintain the status quo and refrain from reaching an accommodation with the Palestinians. If this cover was removed, the US could refrain from vetoing any UN resolution calling for the creation of a Palestinian state. As for the UN, its numerous resolutions against Israel speak for themselves. As of 2013, the UN Security Council had adopted 77 resolutions critical of Israel and only 1 against the Palestinians. For her part, Israel continues to ignore such resolutions.
\\
\\
Israel’s relationship with Islamic countries, notably Iran, is non-existent. Iran maintains that there can be no two-state solution; in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s view there can be only one state and that would be called Palestine under Muslim rule. The international political situation is rapidly aligning itself to Bible prophecy which says that at the end of this age all nations will be aligned against Israel.
\\
\\
Israel suffers from unjustified international prejudice or bias against her. The result is widespread misunderstanding and ignorance of the true nature and purpose of Israel. This bias comes from the general public, the media, political organizations (as in the UN and EU), and even the church (as in the World Council of Churches, WCC). Invariably it has one underlying objective – to change Israeli government policy with respect to ownership and use of land e.g. land boundaries, and with respect to Israel’s claim on Jerusalem. At its extreme, bias aims to bring down the country and destroy it.
\\
\\
The United Nations does Israel no favours by passing many resolutions against Israel. As of 2012, the UN had passed 79 resolutions directly critical of Israel, and 40\% of UN Human Rights Council Resolutions have been against Israel. EU bias became clear in 2014 when the parliaments of Sweden, Britain, France, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Luxembourg voted in support of recognizing, in principle, a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders
\\
\\
Legal misinformation again from the media, leads to the frequent but erroneous claim that “Israel occupies Palestinian land”; legally it does not. Sadly, the World Council of Churches (WCC) tends to follow this misinformation, link, and the institutionalized churches e.g. the Anglican Church lean to the view that the church has replaced Old Testament Israel (Replacement Theology).
